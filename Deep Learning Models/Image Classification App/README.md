# Image Classification App üñºÔ∏èüîç

This application allows you to classify images using state-of-the-art deep learning models. Upload an image, select a model, and the app will predict the most likely labels for the image!

## How it works

1. **Select Model**: Choose one of the available deep learning models from the sidebar.
2. **Upload Image**: Upload an image file (JPEG, JPG, or PNG) that you want to classify.
3. **Image Classification**: The app will use the selected model to predict the labels for the uploaded image.
4. **Display Results**: The top predicted labels along with their confidence scores are displayed, along with the image.

## How to use

### Running the app locally

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. üñ•Ô∏è
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the required dependencies by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. üõ†Ô∏è
4. Run the Streamlit app using the command: `streamlit run main.py`. üèÉ
5. Access the app in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`. üåê

### Docker containerization

1. **Build Docker Image**:
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
   - Run the following command to build the Docker image:
     ```
     docker build -t image-classification-app:latest .
     ```
   - This command will build a Docker image named `image-classification-app` with the latest tag.

2. **Run Docker Container**:
   - Once the Docker image is built successfully, you can run a Docker container using the following command:
     ```
     docker run -p 8501:8501 image-classification-app:latest
     ```
   - This command will start a Docker container based on the `image-classification-app` image and map port 8501 on your local machine to port 8501 in the container.

3. **Access the App**:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the Image Classification App running inside the Docker container. üö¢

## Available Models

- **VGG16**
- **VGG19**
- **Inception**
- **Xception**
- **ResNet**

## Example

Suppose you upload an image of a dog. If you select the VGG16 model, the app might predict that the image contains a "golden retriever" with a confidence score of 0.8 (80%). Additionally, it may suggest other possible labels and their confidence scores.

Enjoy classifying images with the Image Classification App! üéâ
