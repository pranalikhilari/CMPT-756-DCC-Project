# Text To Image Generator App üñºÔ∏è

This application allows you to generate images from text prompts using cutting-edge AI models. Simply enter a text prompt, and the app will create a beautiful image based on your input!

## How it works

1. **Input Prompt**: Enter a text prompt describing the image you want to generate.
2. **Generate Image**: Click the "Generate Image" button to initiate the image generation process.
3. **Image Generation**: The app sends your text prompt to a powerful AI model hosted by Hugging Face's Inference API. The model generates an image based on your prompt.
4. **Display Image**: Once the image is generated, it is displayed on the screen along with your original prompt.
5. **Image Saving**: The generated image is saved locally and can be downloaded or shared as needed.
